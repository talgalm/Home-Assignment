# Infinite Scroll Implementation

## Overview
The application now supports infinite scroll functionality for both regular movie listings and search results. When users scroll to the bottom of the movie grid, more movies are automatically fetched and added to the display.

## Features

### Infinite Scroll for Regular Movies
- Automatically loads more movies when scrolling to the bottom
- Shows a loading spinner while fetching additional pages
- Displays "No more movies to load" when all movies have been fetched
- **Desktop Support**: Automatically loads more content when the page is not tall enough to scroll

### Infinite Scroll for Search Results
- Works seamlessly with the search functionality
- Loads additional search results as the user scrolls
- Maintains search context while loading more results

### Visual Indicators
- **Loading Spinner**: Appears at the bottom when fetching more movies with descriptive text
- **End Message**: Shows "No more movies to load" when all content is loaded
- **Smooth Integration**: Works with existing favorites filtering
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop

## Technical Implementation

### New Hooks Created
1. **`useInfiniteMovies`** - Handles infinite queries for regular movie listings
2. **`useInfiniteSearchMovies`** - Handles infinite queries for search results
3. **`useInfiniteScroll`** - Detects when user scrolls to bottom and triggers loading

### Updated Components
1. **`MovieGrid`** - Added loading indicators and end-of-content message
2. **`Home`** - Integrated infinite scroll with both regular and search queries

### API Integration
- Uses React Query's `useInfiniteQuery` for efficient data fetching
- Supports pagination with page parameters
- Automatically detects when no more pages are available
- Includes caching with 5-minute stale time and 10-minute garbage collection

### Desktop Optimization
- **Initial Load Detection**: Automatically loads more content when the page height is insufficient for scrolling
- **Resize Handling**: Responds to window resize events to load more content if needed
- **Threshold Management**: Uses configurable threshold for scroll detection

## Usage
The infinite scroll functionality works automatically - no user interaction required beyond normal scrolling. Users can:

1. Scroll through the movie grid normally
2. See a loading spinner with "Loading more movies..." text when more content is being fetched
3. Continue scrolling to load additional pages
4. See an end message when all content has been loaded
5. **Desktop users**: Content automatically loads even when the page is not tall enough to scroll

## Configuration
The pagination logic assumes each page contains 10 movies. If your API uses a different page size, you can adjust the `expectedPageSize` variable in the infinite query hooks:

```typescript
const expectedPageSize = 10; // Adjust this based on your API
```

## Browser Compatibility
Works in all modern browsers that support:
- `window.scrollY`
- `window.innerHeight`
- `document.documentElement.scrollHeight`
- Event listeners for scroll and resize events

## Troubleshooting

### Desktop Not Loading Initially
If you don't see the loader on desktop when there are only a few movies:
1. The system automatically detects when the page is not tall enough to scroll
2. It will automatically trigger loading more content
3. The loading spinner will appear at the bottom of the grid
4. This ensures a consistent experience across all devices

### Performance Optimizations
- React Query caching reduces unnecessary API calls
- Debounced scroll events prevent excessive function calls
- Resize events are throttled to prevent performance issues
